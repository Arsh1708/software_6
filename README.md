###POINT_CLOUD IMAGE
I uploaded the Kaggle NYU dataset on Google Colab and took an example depth and color image set named 1.png and 1.jpg respectively in the code.<br>
Load the color and depth images using open3D. <br>
Make a RGBD image using these.<br>
Make a point cloud image using the default intrinsic parameters and display it using open3D.
